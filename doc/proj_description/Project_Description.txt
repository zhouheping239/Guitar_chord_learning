1. Introduction
1.1.  Project title: Basic Guitar Learning
1.2.  Motivation: 
   Music has been a way for people to communicate and express their emotion. In the current era, the convenience of the internet allows people to access any information and learn new things and we want to contribute some material related to music. As we know, guitar is one of the well-known of its unique and relaxing sound and popularity in the internet. This 6-stringed instrument is very easy to be learned for a novice player and will get more challenging to the advanced player. We hope that by providing some basic guitar material (guitar chords for song and its shapes), new guitarist can teach their selves some basic knowledge about guitar to start their own journey, and allows them to express their emotion with music.
1.3.  Function:
   By providing some basic guitar learning, new guitarist or even more advanced guitarist can learn some basic skill about guitar. This self-learning method will allow players to learn anything they want with their own pace and style. By playing users favourite songs from the song database, learning guitar with the help of chords movement along the lyrics will be easier and enjoyable.

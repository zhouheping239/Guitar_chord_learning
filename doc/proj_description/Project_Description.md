## 1. Introduction

1.1.  Project title: Basic Guitar Learning

1.2.  Motivation: 
   Music has been a way for people to communicate and express their emotion. In the current era, the convenience of the internet allows people to access any information and learn new things and we want to contribute some material related to music. As we know, guitar is one of the well-known of its unique and relaxing sound and popularity in the internet. This 6-stringed instrument is very easy to be learned for a novice player and will get more challenging to the advanced player. We hope that by providing some basic guitar material (guitar chords for song and its shapes), guitarists can teach themselves how to play guitar and the chords to start their own journey, and allows them to express their emotion with music.

1.3.  Function:
   By providing lyrics and chords of songs, any level of guitarist can learn to play the song on their guitar. This self-learning method will allow players to learn the song they want with their own pace and style. From the chord table page, not only the user can search for the chord that they needed to play the song, the user also able to discover other new chord that they are not familiar with and learn how to play different chord.
